# P5 project

### **_Introduction_**
This program was made as a university group project.

## Abstract of the project:
### **_Purpose:_**
This paper investigates how patients with
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) can be able to get
more involved through the disease progress by the
inclusion of observing their own scan images from
the different scans. Furthermore this paper examines
how the cardiologists can obtain more information
about the patients health condition by interpreting
the feedback evaluations from the patients.
### **_Methods:_**
To develop the system the iterative waterfall
model has been applied as a system development
process. In addition, the system has been developed
by using object oriented programming in combination
with object oriented analysis and design.
### **_Results:_**
The results from testing of the system
presented the capability of providing scan images as
well as the evaluations for the patients. Furthermore
the test also showed that the cardiologist is able to
observe the scan images of the exact patient as well
as the evaluation filled in by the patient. The system
is also able to display a graph and an average score
which can be used to understand the patientâ€™s health
condition during the diagnosis process.
Conclusion: Based on the test results this paper
concludes that the system is able to show scan images
for the patients. The system test is fullfilled but
before the system can be used in the clinical practice
it requires further development.

## How to run the program
Import the project in your prefered Java IDE and run the code.
Note that the database no longer exist, so most of the program will not function.
